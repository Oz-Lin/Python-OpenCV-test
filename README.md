# Python-OpenCV-test
Testzone dealing with Python OpenCV optical charactor recognition (OCR).

Combine with Machine learning (both conventional and deap learning).
Plan for TensorFlow + Keras.

Finally move to PyQt6 for the graphical interface (GUI).

Ultimately the next step of handwriting text recognition would be dealing with
cursive writing. See for example transkibus at https://www.transkribus.org/
